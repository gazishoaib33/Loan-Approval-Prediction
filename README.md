# Loan Approval Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on historical application data. This repository contains data analysis, model training, and prediction logic to help automate the loan review process.

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a common real-world problem for banks and financial institutions. Instead of manually going through all applications, this project uses machine learning to **analyze key applicant information** (such as income, credit history, education, and loan amount) and **predict the loan decision** accurately.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Loads loan application dataset  
- Handles missing values and preprocesses the data  
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Trains machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluates model performance  
- Outputs predictions for loan approval or rejection
